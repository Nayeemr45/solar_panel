              'This ideal situation is naturally not always feasible due to structural requirements, shading from neighboring buildings, mountains or trees. However, roof areas that are oriented towards the west or east also offer high solar potential, depending on the location , as yield losses of up to 10% must be expected. In addition, solar power generators have the advantage that with a west or east-facing roof they generate a larger proportion of the electricity produced in the morning or in the evening - i.e. precisely at the times when most electricity is needed in households. Only areas facing north remain in the shade all day and are therefore not suitable.'

A solar system with a size of 24.2 m² can produce approx. 4,250 kWh and theoretically covers the average annual consumption of a family of four.'

            text2={
              'The service life of a solar system depends on the solar cells used. According to the current state of development, you can expect amorphous solar cells to have a useful life of 20 to 25 years. Depending on the manufacturer, the service life of crystalline solar cells is even stated to be up to 30 years. It is important to know that the performance of the modules decreases over the years. You should expect a reduction of 0.2% to 0.5% per year. This means that after 20 years with the same level of light irradiation, a solar system still achieves 90% of the original electricity yield.'
